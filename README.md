# Gophercises

This repo contains my solutions to the gophercises exercises. Each exercise is in its own folder and contains a README with the exercise details.

This repo is a work in progress and I will be adding more exercises as I complete them. I will also be updating the README for each exercise with my thoughts on the exercise and any other notes I have.

The exercises are taken from the [gophercises](https://gophercises.com/) website.
